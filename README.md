# NPL-emotion-LA
Small research for testing accuracy of a few classifiers as SVM, Biyes classifier
and KNN. The five emotions was classified and got plots of accuracy by each emotion
for each classifier. Also, a telegram bot was created to use SVM in practice on real
data. Read [Final report](https://github.com/Ikonsty/NPL-emotion-LA/blob/main/Final_report.pdf) for further details.
