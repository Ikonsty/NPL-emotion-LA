# NPL-emotion-LA
Small research for testing accuracy of a few classifiers as SVM, Biyes classifier
and KNN. We used these algorithms to recognise which emotions are placed in messages, emails, reviews.
The five emotions (joy, sad, anger, fear, and neutral) was classified and got plots of accuracy by each emotion
for each classifier. Also, a telegram bot was created to use SVM in practice on real
data. Read [Final report](https://github.com/Ikonsty/NPL-emotion-LA/blob/main/Final_report.pdf) for further details.
